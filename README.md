# Github Java Insight
1. Quickstart
2. Introduction
Our goal this hackathon was to visualize a developer's Java abilities based on their publically available GitHub profile. There are already many publically available tools for analyzing GitHub profiles, so we wanted to create a product that would both provide comparable functionality while also introducing some novel insights. Ultimately, our goal was to have a website that help hiring managers or recruiters evaluate potential candidates.
We identified five areas of interest for scoring Java developers:
* versatility
* code quality
* community engagement
* best practices
* GitHub activity
Our app computes these metrics and aggregates them to assign a final score. It also displays a breakdown of all the individual results that contributed to these metrics.
Our project is unique in that it sources information not only from GitHub metadata, but it also performs an analysis of the code itself. Additionally, we added a feature to compare the compatibility of two engineers based on their metric subscores.
